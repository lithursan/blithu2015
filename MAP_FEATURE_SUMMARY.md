- Haversine formula for accurate distance calculations
- Responsive viewBox for different screen sizes

### **Real-time Updates:**
- WebSocket subscriptions for instant location changes
- 30-second auto-refresh interval
- Manual refresh capability
- Optimized database queries

### **Mobile Optimization:**

## 📍 Store Location:
- **Coordinates**: 9.384489°N, 80.408737°E
